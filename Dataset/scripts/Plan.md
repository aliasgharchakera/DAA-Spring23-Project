## Dataset

### Groups of Instances

We will all in all have 7 groups

1.  Base Dataset (By artemisa)
2.  Very Large n (Nummber of items)
3.  Very Large c (Capacity)
4.  Very large c & n
5.  Very large values of ci
6.  Very large values of vi
7.  Very Large values of ci & vi

### Files format

In each dataset instance, the first line is the optimum, the next line contains space separated c and n, after that, there are n lines with space separated ci and vi where i ranges from 1 to n. <br>

### Generating the instances

We only had 21 examples from the dataset obtained from aforementioned source. <br>
For this purpose I have written a few scripts stored in `Dataset/scripts`
